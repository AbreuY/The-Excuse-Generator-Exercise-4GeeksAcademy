# The-Excuse-Generator-Exercise-4GeeksAcademy
BreatheCode Coding Projects tutorials and exercises for people learning to code or improving their coding skills.

The Goal
* We wanted a project that uses very little Javascript but still with a very fun application. The excuse generator takes 20 lines of code, is super simple to understand and is the perfect first project for any beginner developer.

Instructions
* Please create a small website that generates an excuse each time a button is pressed.
